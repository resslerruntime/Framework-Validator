# Framework Validator

The project
Framework Validator is a validator for websites built with frontend frameworks like Foundation or Bootstrap. 

Framework Validator is now a part of Frontend Ocean http://frontendocean.com

  
# CDL Language  

To describe available frameworks, I have created a human-like language / compiler.  
The compiler:  
 checks element's static structure and properties/classes  
 checks construction rules  
 checks and adds properties from other (base) elements  
 generates a framework description file
